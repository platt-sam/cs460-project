	Fall 2021 Assignment Tracker - Shows of the "Section Status" Trigger by Updating a students grade

	-->

	<font size ="+2"><b>Section Status Trigger</b></font>

	<p><b>Implemented By:</b> Peter Jacobson</p>

	<p><b>Description:</b> When a grade is updated in the roster table the instructor_id, dateTime, and change will be logged into a rosterLog table.</p> 

	<p><b>Justification:</b>  An instructor should not be changing a student's grade often or after the grading window closes. If a student suspects an instructor is out for them this trigger may help provide proof. Unlikely but somehow it may also help catch unauthorized users making grade changes.</p>

	<p><b>Expected Output:</b> A table with information on a grade change. Table with entries of (#, 3201, 94012345, 'A', 'F', jacobsonp, about the current time) expected in example provided. </body>
